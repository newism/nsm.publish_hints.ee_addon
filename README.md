NSM Publish Hints 1.0.2
=======================

Overview
--------

NSM Publish Hints is an [ExpressionEngine 2][ee2] custom field that allows you to add publishing hints to a channel. Out of the box functionality allows you to add per field instructions but these can't be hidden and can take up a lot of room.

NSM Publish Hints addresses this issue by displaying hints for each field in a single box that can be hidden by default using standard custom field settings.

Looking for an EE1 version? Try [Dulee Noted](http://masugadesign.com/the-lab/scripts/dulee-noted/) by Ryan Masuga which is the base concept of NSM Publish Hints
